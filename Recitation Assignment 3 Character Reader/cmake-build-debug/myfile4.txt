An International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a code of 10 characters, referred to as ISBN-10, 
separated by dashes such as 0-7637-0798-8. An ISBN-10 consists of four parts: a group code, a publisher code, 
a code that uniquely identifies the book among those published by a particular publisher, and a check character. 
The check character is used to validate an ISBN. For the ISBN 0-7637-0798-8, the group code is 0, 
which identifies the book as one from an English-speaking country. The publisher code 7637 is for "Jones and Bartlett Publishers".
