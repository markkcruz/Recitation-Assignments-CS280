Prior to the launch of new technologies we hear of the benefits these latest
developments will bring. As the latest innovations become integrated with,
and form the infrastructure of, everyday living, we begin to experience some
less positive aspects. Clearly, computer technology brings both benefits and
disadvantages - the degree to which either has an impact on individuals and
their ability to live a "good life"^ is the degree to which ethics is relevant to
computing.
A number of ethical issues have been discussed and debated over the
last twenty years or so under the broad category of "computer ethics". This
rather loose term has been criticised for placing ethics - a uniquely human
characteristic - onto computers. Despite early predictions in Artificial
Intelligence we are still far from being able to ascribe a moral viewpoint to
mechanical devices. If, however, we talk about the ethics of computing we
are talking about the use of computers - thus placing the moral perspective
(and consequently the moral responsibility) firmly in the hands of
computing professionals and the users.
